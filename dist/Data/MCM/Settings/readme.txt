This folder contains user settings (also known as ModSettings) for MCM-supported mods.

ModSetting changes are stored as per-mod INI files in this folder. These files are automatically created by the MCM in this folder when a setting is changed from the default.

Settings stored in this folder are safe against mod updates and will not be lost should a mod introduce new ModSettings. Values stored in this folder will always override the default setting value defined by the mod author.
